                    <p>Foodies World (stylized as foodies world) is an online food delivery platform owned by L.KHAN Delivery Hero. Foodies World operates as the lead brand for Delivery Hero in Asia, with its headquarters in Singapore. It is currently the largest food delivery platform in Asia, outside of China, operating in 12 markets across Asia.

In 2012, Swiss Lukas Nagel and Rico Wyder established Foodpanda in Singapore, before expanding to Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand.</p>

<p>A year later in 2013, Foodpanda was launched in Bangladesh and Romania. With more than 20,000 employees operating in their company, Foodpanda became the largest food delivery service in Bangladesh.

In 2014, the service expanded into the Balkans, Brunei, as well as the Philippines. In February 2014, Foodpanda acquired Eat Oye, a rival company in Pakistan. Global expansion of the Foodpanda business was led by Ralf Wenzel, Felix Plog and Ben Bauer.

In 2015, co-founder Rohit Chadda stepped down from the company. By 2016, none of the original managing directors or co-founders remained with the company. Its operations in Indonesia also shut down due to competition from flourishing app-based taxi-motorbike services, while the company sold its Delivery Club business in Russia to Mail.Ru for $100 million in November 2016.

Foodies World's largest investor Rocket Internet sold the company to Delivery Hero in December 2016. On 1 November 2017, Foodies World re-branded and changed its brand colour from orange to pink with an updated logo across all served countries, following its acquisition by Delivery Hero.</p>

<p>In April 2018, the company left the Brunei market.</p>

<p>By 2019, Foodpanda had gone through three rounds of management changes.</p>

<p>From 2019 to 2020, Foodies World began operating in other markets in Southeast Asia, launching in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. Foodies World was also launched in Japan in September 2020.</p>
